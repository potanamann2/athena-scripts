// Title: RO Credit Card; Includes Various rates (That can be modified easily by editing variables in the script)
// 
// System:
// 
// 
// 
// 
// Whatever card the player chooses, the player will receive that card. They will have the option of buying items
// from an npc using either their own zeny or the card. When payments are due, an npc prompt will come up when the player
// logs in, and every hour they are logged in they receive a PM from an npc (regardless of whisper block status; see note 1 
// for pm/npc prompt format) until they pay any outstanding fees. If they don't pay the first due date, interest is compunded If they do not pay any debts over a 2 month period (1 month for platinum cards), any items purchased using the card will be repo'd, and they receive a zeny fine of 20% of their zeny.
// 
// EDIT1: The items purchased should be untradeable as well. The debt should go to the whole account, from the character that has the most zeny.
// 
// Note 1: 
	dispbottom "Credit Collector: Attention, "+strcharinfo(0)+"! You have outstanding Credit fees due!";
	dispbottom "Credit Collector: ------------------------------";
	dispbottom "Credit Collector: Monthly Fees: XXXXX zeny";
	dispbottom "Credit Collector: Credit Fees: ZZZZZ zeny";
	dispbottom "Credit Collector: Total Credit due: XZXZX zeny";
	dispbottom "Credit Collector: ------------------------------";
	dispbottom "Credit Collector: Please pay any outstanding fees, or any items purchased with the card will be repo'd, along with a zeny fine!";
// 
// 
// Again, thanks ahead of time for anyone who takes the inititive to make this!
