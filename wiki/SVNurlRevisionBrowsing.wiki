  # Figure out the *base url* (i.e. the directory that does not have a *..* link to the parent directory).
   Ex: <b>http://rathena.googlecode.com/svn/</b>trunk/conf/
  # Append !svn/bc/REVISION/ to the end of the base url.
   Ex: http://rathena.googlecode.com/svn/!svn/bc/14000/
  Google Code has an additional custom URL: /svn-history/rREVISION/PATH/
   Ex: http://rathena.googlecode.com/svn-history/r14000/trunk/
